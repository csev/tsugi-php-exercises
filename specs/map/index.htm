In this assignment we will explore using JavaScript in Tsugi.  We have 
a partially completed class map with a few bugs you need to fix.  We also
explore how you can use the test harness to switch between users and roles.
</p>
<h2>Pre-Requisites</h2>
<p>
You need to have the Tsugi software installed, with the database configured 
and up and running.  Please see the instructions at 
<a href="http://www.tsugi.org" target="_blank">www.tsugi.org</a> to 
download and install the PHP version of Tsugi.
</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>
Select <code>exercises/map/index.php</code> from the <b>Developer</b> screen 
and you should be able to launch into the map application.
You can use the "Jane Instructor" drop-down to switch between 
the instructor and either of the two students accounts so you can 
set up more than one map entry.

<h2>Your Assignment</h2>
<p>
This program has two problems that were left broken and/or incomplete by 
the previous programmer.  The first task is to fix a bug.   No matter 
where you try to move your location and save it, it jumps to the middle 
of Greenland.  This is a JavaScript bug and once you find the bad code, 
a bit of web searching should lead you to a solution pretty quickly.    
Make sure you are looking the JavaScript console in your web browser as 
the program is running - it will greatly speed debugging.
</p>
<p>
The second task is to add a feature.  Once you solve the first problem 
and use the student and instructor accounts to put three markers on 
the map you will notice that when you hover for a second over someone 
else's (green) marker there is a title that pops up.  The goal is to 
make it so the person's actual display name shows up instead of the 
placeholder text.  This will require a bit of work in both the PHP 
and JavaScript.
</p>
<h2>Turn In</h2>
<p>
If you are doing this for credit, please hand in or demonstrate 
to the instructor:
<ul>
<li>A screen shot of your application showing the URL where the application 
is running with at least three markers and you hovering over the green 
marker and showing one user's displayname</li>
<li>The source code to your modified <code>exercises/map/index.php</code></li>
<li>A screen shot of PHPMyAdmin showing the entries in the sample_map table</li>
</ul>
