<h1>Assignment: Installing GIT and Tsugi</h1>
<p>
In this assignment you will install the GIT source code managment software.
GIT allows you to carefully track changes to source code.
We can use GIT to store our project in anoy of a number of 
respositories.  GitHub is probably the most popular public 
repositories.   If you have an email address ending in ".edu"
GitHub provides some very nice free options.
</p>
<h1>GIT Resources</h1>
<p>There are several resources you might find useful:

Once you have completed this exercise, you can start the next exercise

</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h1>Installing GIT</h1>
<p>
The first step is to install GIT if you do not already have it installed.  
If you have GIT installed - you can skip this step.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Macintosh: If you have 10.9 or later open a command line and install git using:
<pre>
xcode-select --install
</pre>
Then try to run <b>git</b> from the command line to see if it was installed.  
If that does not work, download and install the GIT client from
<pre>
<a href="http://git-scm.com/download/mac" target="_blank">http://git-scm.com/download/mac</a>
</pre>
</li>
<li>Windows: Download and install the GIT client from
<a href="http://msysgit.github.com/" target="_blank">http://msysgit.github.com/</a>. 
Note that as you install, you should
choose <b>Run Git From Windows Command Prompt </b> rather
than the default of <b>Use Git Bash only </b> as seen in this image:<br/>
<img src="01-Git-Setup.png" style="margin-top: 5px" width="400px"><br/>
</ul>
You do not have to follow these instructions exactly as long as one way or another you 
have a working git on your computer so you can take the next steps.
</p>
<h2>Configuring GIT</h2>
<p>
Once you have GIT installed and working from the command line, you 
need to configure your name and email address with the following commands in the
command line / terminal:
<pre>
git config --global user.name "John Doe"

git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
</pre>
This way you will get credit for any changes you make that you submit to a 
repository as patches.  
</p>
<p>
In you installed git some other way, just make sure to configure your name and
email address before starting to use git.
</p>
<h1>Installing Tsugi from GitHub</h1>
<p>
So now we need to use git to check Tsugi out from GitHub.  
</p>
<h2>Tsugi Resources</h2>
<p>
Here are some resources for Tsugi installation:
<ul>
<li>Tsugi <a href="https://www.tsugi.org/docs" target="_blank">
Installation Documentation</a></li>
<li>Tsugi <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_QDXp-Y7o&list=PLlRFEj9H3Oj5WZUjVjTJVBN18ozYSWMhw" target="_blank">Installation Video</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
The primary task is to get the code checked out into your web server's web documents 
folder (i.e. htdocs):
<pre>
cd /Applications/MAMP/htdocs
git clone https://github.com/tsugiroject/tsugi.git
</pre>
And then follow the rest of the steps inthe installation documentation or video.
<p>
Once you copy the file config-dist.php to config.php and edit config.php to set up 
your global variables and database connection, make sure to set developer mode to 
TRUE and change the admin password so you can create the tables.  
Also set the name of the service to be your first name:
<pre>
$CFG-&gt;servicename = 'Charles';
</pre>
<p>
Tsugi tries to give you hints when it is improperly configured that guide
you toward the next step in configuration.  For example if you have a good 
database connection but no database tables defines, you see the following screen:
</p>
<p>
<center><img src="02-Tsugi-Not-Configured.png" style="width: 90%; border: 1px solid black"></center>
</p>
<p>
In Tsugi, you do not need to run "CREATE TABLE" statements.  Tsugi has an administration
mode where it does all the needed "CREATE TABLE" statements.
</p>
<p>
Once you have run the "CREATE DATABASE" statements and put the database 
name, prefix (optional), database id and database pw into config.php -
you use the Admin feature (with the password from config.php) and it 
will create your tables.  You should verify that the tables were created 
using PHPMyAdmin and looking in the "tsugi" database.
<p>
When your installation an table initialization is complete, you should see a 
running Tsugi with your name in the output as follows:
</p>
<p>
<center><img src="03-Tsugi-Installed.png" style="width: 90%; border: 1px solid black"></center>
</p>
<h1>What to Hand In</h1>
<p>
For this assignment you will hand in:
<ol>
<li>A screen shot (including the URL) of Tsugi
running on your local computer</li>
<li>A screen shot of PHPMyAdmin showing the tables in the 
Tsugi database.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Sample Screen Shots</h1>
<p>
The Tsugi database tables in PHPMyAdmin:<br/>
